## Daily Blind 75

Welcome to the Blind 75, I did not help create or compile these problems. But I did create this nifty tool to help you learn them. 

This app will pick a random problem between 1 and 75 that you have not previously had
that number corresponds to a problem from the blind 75 list (https://neetcode.io/practice)
all of these problems are from LeetCode and are common interview questions

create a directory for each problem and a file for the problem and test suit (utilize any testing library you want)

get a random number
```
node start.js
```
